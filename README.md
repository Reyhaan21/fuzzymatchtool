# fuzzymatchtool
**FuzzyMatchTool** is a lightweight .NET console utility that compares two strings using fuzzy logic (via the [FuzzySharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FuzzySharp) library).   It determines whether two strings are a match based on a specified **confidence threshold** and **matching method**.
